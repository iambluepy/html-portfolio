<p>Long ago the infamous Gol D. Roger was the strongest and most powerful pirate on the seas. As he was about to be
    executed he revealed that he hid all of his wealth, including the legendary treasure known as One Piece, on an
    island at the end of the Grand Line - a treacherous and truly unpredictable sea.</p>
<p>Monkey D. Luffy is a spirited, energetic and somewhat dim-witted young man with a very big dream: to find One Piece
    and become the Pirate King! However Luffy is no ordinary boy, as when he was younger he ate one of the Devil's
    Fruits and gained its power to become a Rubber Man. Now in this grand age of pirates Luffy sets out to gather a crew
    and sail to the most dangerous sea in the world so that he can fulfill his dream... and maybe even his appetite!</p>

<p>Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing
    humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their
    taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival,
    the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single
    titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly
    impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.</p>
<p>After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to
    their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids
    outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert
    join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are
    breached.</p>

<h3>Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood</h3>

<p>After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a
    catastrophic new reality. Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted to bring
    their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body
    disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by
    binding it to a hulking suit of armor.</p>
<p>The brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical
    engineering prodigy, Winry creates prosthetic limbs for Edward by utilizing "automail," a tough, versatile metal
    used in robots and combat armor. After years of training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their
    bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stoneâ€”a powerful gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of
    Equivalent Exchange.</p>
<p>As Edward becomes an infamous alchemist and gains the nickname "Fullmetal," the boys' journey embroils them in a
    growing conspiracy that threatens the fate of the world.</p>
