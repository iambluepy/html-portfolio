<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, Lekziee here! A Capricorn - Earth baby with a mild OCD and clean freakness . I'm currently balancing my career in
  Civil Engineering while diving into the world of web development. </p>
<p>When I'm not working or learning, you'll find me immersed in the world of anime and manga. I love how they tell
  unique stories that combine artistry, culture, and emotion. Hit me up if you have recommendations you'd like to share.
</p>
<p>Traveling is another passion of mine. I enjoy exploring new destinations, experiencing different cultures, and
  gaining fresh perspectives. Whether it's a long weekend getaway or a long journey abroad, traveling fuels my
  creativity and keeps me energized.</p>
<p>I believe in setting clear goals and working steadily toward them, but I also know the importance of balance-between
  work, creativity, and adventure.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
